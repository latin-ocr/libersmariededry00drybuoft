xx THE PREFACE.

Tne Annors tained that this address was agreed to on the part of the King by the appoint-

⁶⁰⁷mnued' ment of the nominee of the convent.

At that time their election may have
had but little weight in inducing the king to give effect to it.

There is indeed no sufficient evidence, that after the death or demission of
abbot Andrew Liderdale, 'about the year 1506, Dryburgh ever had another
abbot properly so called. During the Subsequent century that the abbey
continued to exist as a religious house, it was held in commendam. A list

fo⁰a⁵ss⁸i>i÷⁸ffln of the Commendators will now be given. The first was,—

tributes the Archbishop's favour at the courts
of Rome and France to his having had the
address to bring about a peace between Pope
Julius II. and Louis XII„ when they were
in the field, at the head of their respective
armies, ready to give each other battle. But
this is not supported by history. The same
author gives the following curious, but absurd,
account of a banquet, by Forman to the pope
and eardinals2—“Then this bischope maid
ane banquett to the Pope and all his cardi-
nallis, in one of the Pope's awin palaces, and
when they war all sett according to thair cus-
tome, that he who ought the hous for the tyme
should say the grace; and he was not ane
guid scholler, nor had not guid Latine, bot
begane rudlie in the Scottise faschioun, saying

‘ Benedicite,' beleivand that they schould have
said ‘ Dominus.’ bot they answeired, ‘ Deus:
in the Italiane faschioun, quhilk pat the bis-
chope by his intendment, that he wist not
weill how to proceid fordward, bot happened
in guid Scottis in this manner, sayand quhilk
they vnderstuid not, ‘ The divill I give you all
false cardinallis to, in nomine Patris, Filij, et
Spiritus Sancti, Amen.’ 'rhen all the bis-
chope’s men leugh, and all the cardinallis
thamselffis3 and the Pope inquyred quhairat
they leugh, and the bischop schew that he
was not ane guid clark‚ and that his cardinallis
had put him by his text and intendment,
