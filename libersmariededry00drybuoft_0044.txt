xxxvi THE PREFACE.

The estate of Dryburgh was again sold, in 1786, by Colonel Tod's
trustees, to David, late Earl of Buchan, who thus re-acquired the part of

‘js- the property which had belonged to his ancestors, the Earl of Mar and the
· Lords Gardross. In 1810, his Lordship executed an entail, in virtue of

which, on his death in 1829, his son, the late Sir David Erskine, succeeded
to Dryburgh, and on whose death, without issue, in 1837, the present Earl
of Buchan, the nephew of Earl David, became the proprietor.¹

Having thus traced the History of this once famous Religious House
through its various vicissitudes, from its Foundation to ,the present time,
we shall close these Prefatory Remarks with a parting glance at the situa-
tion and ruins of the Abbey.

Dryburgh is situated in the parish of Mertoun, on the south-western
confines of the county of Berwick. It stands three miles below Melrose,
and ten miles above Kelso, on a flat sequestered lawn, on the north side of
the Tweed, nearly surrounded by one of its finest turns, with high woody
banks on every side, and in sight of the celebrated and picturesque Eildon
Hills, the Trimontium of the Romans. Such a situation seems to have
been peculiarly suited for retirement from the world and the enjoyment of
the recluse monastic life.

The abbey and its church have been so often ruined and repaired, altered
and added to, that it becomes difficult to trace the plan of the building, or
to ascertain the age of its different parts. There is nothing, however, in
Dryburgh which the student of early architecture can place before the
twelfth century, and but little of that period is preserved. The now roofless
ruins, covered here and there with ivy, and intermingled with lofty treeS,
contrasting with the beauty of the surrounding scenery, render the whole

remarkably imposing and picturesque.
