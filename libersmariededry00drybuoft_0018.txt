x THE PREFACE.

Church, they kept a fast from Holyrood (September 14) till Easter3
taking no food till after Nones, and abstaining entirely from flesh. They
began, however, to relax somewhat of their strict observance of this rule
before the year 12453 and in 1460, Pope Pius II. gave them power tb
dispense with it.

In time of hay-making and harvest, they went to work early in the
morning, and sometimes did not return home till after Vespers; but were
bound to reoite their prayers in the fields at the canonical hours. On festivals
they did no work, but read during the time usually appropriated to that
purpose. Instances, however, occur of special dispensations and permis-
sions to perform work on such occasions. There were no schools in
monasteries of this order ; but no one ignorant of Latin could be admitted
into it. The lay brethren were taught to recite the Creed, the Paternoster‚
Ave Maria, and other prayers3 but were not allowed books.1

The history of the Abbey shall now be shortly traced through its successive
Abbots and Commendators‚ so far as these have been ascertained.

l. Roman was made the first abbot,-—“ Rogerus factus est abbas
primus,” 13th December 1152.2 He was witness to a confirmation by the
archdeacon and whole clergy of Lothian, of a composition between
Melrose and the church of Dunbar, in presence of Richard bishop of St
Andrews‚ regarding the tithes of the granges of Edmundeston and Her-
tesheued.³ He had three bulls addressed to himself by Pope Alexander 111„
confirming grants to his abbey, and permitting service there in time of
general interdict.⁴ “ Rogerus abbas primus de Drieburc curam ovium

resignavit,” in 117 7.⁵
