THE PREFACE. ’ xxxi

It will be afterwards shown that Henry Erskine was assigned by his
father to the Fee of t-he Lordship and Peerage of Cardross, and that he
predeceased his father in 1628.

Α brief account of ,Dryburgh, after it was converted to lay and temporal
purposes, will now complete its history.
Shortly before the Reformation, the Abbots and Convent granted several numm· or

anufflffl

feu-rights of part of the Abbey Lands. In reference to two of these ori- aster-the .
ginal Feus, and the present partition of Dryburgh into two distinct EstateS, Refoma'm‘
with separate Mansion-Houses to each, both situated near to the Abbey, a
little explanation seems necessary.

One portion of the Estate of Dryburgh, with the Mansion-House now
called Dryburgh Abbey‚¹ and which is adjacent to, and on the south side of
the Ruins of the Abbey, belongs to the Earl of Buchan. As this portion
comprehends the ruins, and a great part of the Church Lands, its history
will be afterwards more particularly stated.

The other portion of the Est-ate of Dryburgh, with the Mansion-House
also adjacent to, and on the north side of the Ruins of the Abbey, now
belongs to Charles Riddell, Esq. The original House, which was called the
Mantle House, was built by Alexander Erskine, the founder os the Shiel-
field family, in 1559, on ground feued from the Commendator. This house·
was occupied by the Erskines of Shielfield‚ as their family residence‚ they
being also portioners in Dryburgh, for a period of 234 years, till the year
1793, when they sold it along with their Lands at Dryburgh to Mr Rid-
dell, who pulled it down, and replaced it with the present Mansion.²

¹ This Mansion-House, it is said, was origi· burgh in 1786, made considerable additions
nally built by George Haliburton, in the year to the House, preparatory to adopting it as
1572, on a piece of ground feued from the his residence. (Memorials of the Haliburtons
commendator about 1560. The House was in Dryburgh, 1820, p. 25 ; and Annals and
afterwards, in 1682, repaired and modernized Antiquities of Dryburgh, passim.)

late Earl of Buchan, after he acquired Dry· sim.
