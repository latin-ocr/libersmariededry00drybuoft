and Thomas the younger died in 1551 3 and, according to the above state· ‘ruse nnnnnn
ment, their younger brother John had been Commendator at these dates. ἷέἶιῖἷῖἒα.

On the other hand, it has been stated that this Abbot was John Stewart,
“ the cousin os Lord Darnley, the husband of Mary Queen of ScotS‚’'—-and
that “ his armorial bearings are still on the walls of the Abbey, above the
private entrance into the cloisters for the monks who had overstayed their
time.''¹ The same author gives a drawing of the arms, under which he calls
Abbot John Stewart, not cousin, as in the passage just quoted, but uncle
to Lord Darnley3 and Mr Morton has followed this latter statement?

N one of the Charters granted by this Abbot, which have been recovered,
contain his sirname, and no authority has been found to show whether he
was of the Erskine or the Stewart family. The presumptions are, that he
was of the former. John Erskine, the son of John Lord Erskine, was
Commendator of Inchmahomo 16th August 1552, and he was succeeded in
that office, in 1556, by his nephew, David Erskine.³ This David Erskine,
it will be immediately seen, also became Commendator of Dryburgh about
the same time3 and the probability is, that after John Erskine succeeded to
the title of Lord Erskine, on the death of his father in 1552, and betook
himself to new pursuits and employmentS, he had resigned the offices of
Commendator of Dryburgh and Inchmahomo in favour of his nephew,
David Erskine. Another nephew, Adam Erskine, son of Thomas Master
of Erskine, was made Commendator of Cambuskenneth3 and these three
religious houses continued in the Erskine family, and were ultimately erected
into the Temporal Lordship of Cardross, in favour of J obn Earl of Mar, as

will be afterwards stated.
