xviii THE PREFACE.

incontinent devoid and red the said landis to be broukit and joysit be the
said abbot and convent.''¹

Dean DAvn) DEWAR, a canon of Dryburgh, and vicar of Mertoun,
appears to have claimed to be abbot after the death of Walter, and to have
exercised some of the privileges of the office of abbot, by granting tacks of
certain lands, &c., belonging to the abbey. This occasioned litigation in
the civil court between the respective lessees of Abbot John Orawford and
Dean David Dewar, the competing claimant.

Reports appear on record of actions between these parties regarding lands
in Pencaitland, St John’s Chapel, and others belonging to the abbey, on
26th June 1480, 23d March 1481, and 26th March 1482.2

In another action, reported on 23d January 1488, at the instance of
the abbot and convent of Dryburgh against Adam Bell, ‘⁶ ffor the wrangwis
intrometting, uptakin, and withhalding fra thaim of the teyndis and froitis
of the kirk of Saltoun, in the yere of God 1483 yeris, and the said Adame
Bell agane Dene David Dewar, abbot Jbr tlte time of the said abbay, and
now3 vicar of Mertoun, for the werrandiss of him of the said teyndis and
froitis. All the saidis partis beand present be thaimself and thair procura-
touris, thair richtis, ressounS, and allegatiouns at lenth sene, hard, and
understandin, because the said abbacy was in contentioun betuix the said
partiis the said tyme, and the said Dene Dauid grantis that he aucht to
werrand the said Adame, and is a spirituale and beneficiit man, that thair-
fore the said abbot gere eall the said Dene Dauid before the spirituale juge
for the said mater.” ⁴ And of the same date “ J ohne Hume of Quhitrig‚ as
procurator for the abbot and convent of Driburgh‚ comperit and protestit
that the geuing of the decrett before written suld turne the said abbot and
convent to na prejudice.''⁵
