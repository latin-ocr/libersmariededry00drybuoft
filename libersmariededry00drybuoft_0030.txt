xxii THE PREFACE.

At that time the Borders were the scene of savage devastation, which
Surrey deliberately proposed to perpetuam, by condemning a breadth of
twelve miles of the Scotch border to remain for ever desert and uninhabited.

the 13th of December 1523, Cardinal Accolti, the promoter of Scotch affairs
at Rome, was instructed to obtain his nomination to the vacant abbacy,

executed a declaration in favour of Walter Haliburton and Agnes Stewart,
his spouse, regarding the lands of Nether Shielfield3 ³ and on the 3d of Sep-
tember 1538, Walter Haliburton of Mertoun had a charter of the lands ¹of
Butchercoit, granted by Abbot J ames, with consent of his convent, and sub-
scribed by the abbot himself, the sub-prior, and fifteen canons of the convent
of Dryburgh.⁴ ‘⁶ The offspring of this marriage was an only daughter,
