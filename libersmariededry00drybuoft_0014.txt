vi THE PREFACE.

De Morvilles, states that Hugh “ was the original founder of the monastery
of Dryburgh.''¹

Whether by the King or his High Constable, the abbey of Dryburgh
was founded for monks of the Premonstratensian order in the year 1150.
“ Anno 1150, Ordo Praemonstracensis venit ad Drueburch‚ ad festiuitatem
Sancti Martini '' (November 10.)² They were brought from the abbey of
Alnwick, which was itself a daughter of the abbey of Neuhus‚ the first
foundation of the order in England.³ The Chronicle of Melrose farther
bears ε -“ Anno 1152, Conventus venit ad Driburgh die Sancte Lucie '’ ⁴¹

(December 13th.)

¹ Caledonia, vol. i. pp. 503, 4. The munifi-
cence of David 1. to the church is proverbial.
As Hugh de Morville appears to have been
the earliest benefactor, if not the actual
founder, of the Abbey of Dryburgh, it may
not be out of place to give a short account
of him from the Caledonia: “Among the
English settlers in Scotland, not one was
more early in his attachment, or rose to
greater eminence in the state, than Hugh
Moreville, who came from Burg, in Cumber-
land. Under David, he acquired vast pos-
sessions in Lauderdale, in the Lothians, and,
above all, in Cunninghame, along the northern
bank of the river Irvine. Under his munifi-
cent master, Hugh de Moreville became Con-
stable of Scotland, which office descended,
hereditarily‚ through a long succession of
illustrious heirs, both male and female. He
was the original founder of the monastery of
Dryburgh‚ and he died in 1162. By Beatrice
de Bello-Campo, his wife, he left Richard de
Morville, who enjoyed his high office and
great possessions, and became the principal
Minister of William the Lion. Richard
married Avicia de Lancaster, who is em-
phatically mentioned with him as a patroness

of the Monks of Melrose. Richard de Mor-
ville died in 1189, and his wife Avicia in
1191. They left their opulenee and feuda-
tories to their son william, and a daughter,
Elena‚ who was destined to carry all those
enviable objects into a different family.
William acted a conspicuous part towards
the end of the twelfth century. He married
Christian, though of what family does not ap-
pear, but she brought him no issue3 and he
died in 1196· On the death of William
without lawful children, his high office and
vast estates were enjoyed by Elena and her
husband the Lord of Galloway.”

⁸ Le Paige, Biblioth. Praemcmstrat. ord. ’
In the Oircaria Angliae Borealis et Scotiae, Le
Paige gives six houses of the order in Scot-
land, but so disfigured in spelling, and mis-
placed, that it is difficult to recognise them.
1. Ecclesia viridis stayni, or Saulsete3 a
daughter 01' the chief house of Pre-
montre.
2. Sacri nemoris, Dercongal or Holywood‚
daughter of Saulsete.
3. Candidoe casoe, or Whithorn, a daughter
of Saulsete.
