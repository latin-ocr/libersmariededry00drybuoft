THE PREFACE. xxix

On lOth June 1600, a Lease of teinds of the Maius of Mertoun was 'runc nnnnnn
granted by David, commendator of Dryburgh3 and instead of its bearingss'o *rigis u'e.d
the usual consent of the convent, it states, as a reason for being granted
by the commendator alone, that “all the convent thairos now being Dec ceam aas ael

In virtue of this reservaffion, David continued to grant Leases of certain
of the teinds belonging to the abbey. One of the Leases bears date

“ 30th May 1608, being about fifty years after the first Lease by him above

mentioned, which shows that he had enjoyed his benefice for half a century.
This last Lease bears, in the old form, to be with consent of the convent,
although they had all “decessit '⁹ at least eight years previously. It is
subscribed by David alone.²

The granting of this Lease must have been among the last official acts of
David Erskine, commendator of Dryburgh3 as it is stated in a Deed of
Provision by J ames VI.‚ dated on 31st May 1608, being only the day after
the last-mentioned Lease, and to be immediately noticed, that the abbacy was
then vacant, and in his Majesty’s hands as patron, through the demission of

David commendator of the abbacy of Dryburgh.
After having been so long connected with Dryburgh, David demitted his
