THE PREFACE. vii

Although the rules of the Order of Proemonstratenses‚ thus founded at
Dryburgh, were the same as those observed in other similar institutionS, and
which are well known, it appears appropriate to the present work, and may
be interesting, as this is the first of the Registers of that religious order
which has been published in Scotland, to give a short account of their
manners and employmentS.

In Britain they were‘usually styled White Canons, from the colour of Omma ω
their dress, which consisted of a white cassock, with a rochet and cape over it, ἷζεῖἕὲωμ
a long white cloak, and a square hat or bonnet, of white felt. They likewise
wore breeches and shoes, but no shirt. The abbot wore red shoes, and a
short cloak, and had a pastoral staff, like a shepherd's crook. At first they
were poor, and lived by their labour3 but their piety soon gained them
benefactors, and they became rich. Their possessions were exempted from
paying tithes3 they were not subject to the bishop's jurisdiction3 and they
could not be cited before a secular tribunal. Their time was divided be-
tween their religious exercises, the cultivation of their fields, their household
offices, and reading and ‘transcribing books.

Their devotions, which were performed seven times a-day, began at a
very early hour with MArms, They were awakened by the bell of the dor-
mitory, which was rung as long as would be required to say the seven peni-
tential psalms3 during which time they dressed themselves, and said their
private prayers, until, upon a sign from the prior, they went in processioa
to the church, each individual kneeling in the middle of the choir, and
bowing reverently toward the altar, before taking his seat. The matutinal
service being finished, they returned to bed, and reposed until the hour
of ΡΒῙΜΕ, or six o'clock, when they were summoned to attend during the
