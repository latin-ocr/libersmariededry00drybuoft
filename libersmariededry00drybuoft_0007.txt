TO THE MEMBERS OF THE BANNATYNE CLUB.

Wmm I first undertook to print the Register of Dryburgh for presentation to
the Club, I had never seen it, and was not at all aware of its very imperfect
and defective state.

On examining the proof-sheetS, I perceived that it not only wanted some
of the earliest Charters, which it must have originally contained, and among
· these the Foundation Charter, but that it broke off abruptly, before the suppres-
sion of the Monastery 3 and that, in the greater number of the Charters and other
deeds which the Register still contains, the dates, and the names of the witnesses
are omitted, which considerably diminishes its usefulness.

It disappointed me to think that my contribution to the Club should be so
incomplete3 and I determined, though it might eost some trouble and expense, to
endeavour, as far as possible, to supply the defects of the Register, by obtaining
permission to inspect the repositories of the several persons who now possess lands
formerly belonging to the Abbcy, in order to recovcr and make copies of such
original Charters and other writings relating to it as might still be in existence.

In doing this I had no difficulty. Being unable personally to make this
inspection, I obtained the willing assistance of Mr William Fraser of Edinburgh,
a gentleman well qualified for the task, from his intimate acquaintance with old

writings, and from his zeal and intelligence in antiquarian research. Through
him inspeetion has been made of the title-deeds, &c. of The Duke of Rich-
mond, The Earls of Mar, Buehan, and Lauderdale‚ Lord Polwarth, Sir Wyndham

Carmichael Anstruther of Anstruther and Carmichael, Baronet, David Erskine
Esquire of Cardross‚ J ames Haig Esquire of Bemerside, Charles Riddell Esquire
of Dryburgh, J ames Erskine Esquire of Shielfield, J ames Curle Esquire of
Ivelaw, Adam Fairholme Esquire of (St J ohn’s) Chapel, George Turnbull Esquire
of Abbey St Bathans, and of my brother Lieutenant-Colonel George Spottis-
woode of Gladswood, to all of whom I return my thanks for their courtesy.

Every source that could be thought of to complete the Register has been
explored, and the result of the search will be found in the AppendiX‚ which con-
tains original Charters, Gifts‚ Tacks of Teinds, &c.‚ and several old Rentals of
the Abbey, which are curicus, and may be found useful in assisting to show the
changes produced by time on the value both of land and of money.
