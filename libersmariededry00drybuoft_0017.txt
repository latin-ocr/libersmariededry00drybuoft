the abbot, if present, asked a blessing. During this and their other meals, one uma
of their number standing at a desk in the side of the hall, read to them out of mmm&
the Holy Scriptures, or some other edifying book: and they took this office by
weekly turns. They also waited upon each other at table, in the same
rotation3 having taken their meai previously, along with the reader. They
all stood in their places till blessing was pronounced, after which the reader,
having mounted his desk, began to read, and the rest to eat. Only two dishes
were allowed, except on particular occasions, when another, called a pittance,
usually consisting of some sweet, or more delicate food, was added. It was
brought in after the second dish, and presented to the abbot, or to the' person

went to repose, others conversed till the hour of NoNEs, or three o'clock,
when there was-another service in the church, at the end of which they
washed their handS, and sat down together in the cloister‚ till, a signal
being given, they again entered the refectory, for a few minutes, to
drink. At six o’clock they attended the VEsPERs, or evening service. The
COMPLETORIUM, or Comum, was said or sung in church after seven3 and
then taking a light supper, called GoLLA'no, they went to bed. Sheets were
not allowed, nor any linen, except in sickness3 and they all slept in the
same room, called the dormitory, but in separate beds, in their usual
clothes. Not content with the forty days' abstinence appointed by the
