Abbey does not appear to have been fully rebuilt after this destruction.

In the following year, 1545, the commendator of Dryburgh took his
revenge in an inroad across the English border.²

On the 18th February 1546, Thomas perpetual commendator of the
monastery of Dryburgh, and convent of the same, granted the teinds of
Lauder to Mr Andrew Hume.³

XXX. J om< was commendator of Dryburgh in 1548, on the 12th
July of which year he granted a charter‚ of which only an imperfect note
has been preserved.⁴ On the 20th March 1554, John commendator of
Dryburgh, with consent of the convent, granted and subscribed at Dry-
burgh, a taok of two merks of land in Mertoun to Thomas Myll and
Walter Myll.⁶

This Commendator has been called an Erskine, and a Stewart, without any
sufficient authority being cited for either of the conflicting statementS. Thus,
the late Earl of Buohan, in a letter describing Dryburgh, dated in 1791, states:
—“ Of this Abbey my noble and truly excellent ancestor John Erskino,
afterwards” (Earl of Mar and) “ Regent of the Soots, was Commendator
during the lifetime of his elder brothers, Robert and Thomas, Lords Ers-
kine.''⁶ Robert the elder brother was killed at the battle of Pinkie in 1547,
