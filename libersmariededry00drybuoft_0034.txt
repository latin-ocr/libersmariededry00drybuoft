xxvi THE PREFACE.

'raneonunu- XXXI. DAvn) Ensnms, natural son of Robert Master of Erskine by
ξ’ἒῆἕὲᾗόα, Mrs Jean Home, was the next Commendator of Dryburgh, It has been
seen that he became Commendator of Inchmahomo in 1556, but the exact
31⁸ David date of his appointment to Dryburgh has not been ascertained. On 27th
Enkim' September 1559, he, as Commendator of Dryburgh, with consent of the
Convent, granted a Charter in favour of Alexander Erskine and Elizabeth
Haliburton, of the six merk land in Mertoun.¹ And on lssth J anuary 1562,
David, as Commendator of Inchmahomo, with consent of the Convent,
granted a Tack of the Teinds of Newtoun of Down and Wester Row, in
favour of Allan Oliphant his servitor.2
Great events befell the Abbey during David’s connexion with it. Shortly
after his appointment to the Commendatorship, the full tide of the Reform-
ation had flowed upon this and the other similar religione houses in Scotland.
Dryburgh, with the others, was annexed to the Crown after the Reforma-
tion3 but there was a liferent reservation in favour of the Commendator,
and other possessors of the principal mansions and their precincts, as well
as the titheS, and they continued their residence at the abbey. This Com-
mendator acted a prominent part in the stirring affairs of the times3 and it
will be necessary to give an account of the discharge of the office which he
held for a period so long and important.³
