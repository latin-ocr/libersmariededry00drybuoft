xvi THE PREFACE.

when, on the occasion of a dispute between his abbey and Melrose concerning
the great tithes of the parish of Lesseduen, in presence of the four abbots
of Teviotdale‚ in the chapel of St Mary Magdalene, in the hospital of
Rutherford, an ancient custom was cited, according to which, disputes
occurring between any two were to be settled by the arbitration of the
remaining abbots 3 and abbot James of Dryburgh “respondit quod super
hoc voluit de novo avisare.’'¹

XX. WALTER, abbot of the abbey of Dryburgh, granted a tack, dated
16th November 1465, in favour of a “worschipful squear, William Hali-
burton of Mertoun and J onet his spous, of a plew of land of the Bouchicoits

nesses, Sir Alexander Hume of that ilk, knight, James Haig of Bemer·
syde, Nicholas Forman of Hutton, and Mr Jasper Cranston, rector of
Fetteresso.³ In 1472, Walter appears to have been still abbot of Dry-
burgh 3⁴ and the exact period of his death, or demission of office,has not
been ascertained. -

Walter was probably the abbot of Dryburgh, who on 3lst July 1473,
pursued an action before the Lords Auditors against the Lord Hamiltoun,
“ for ye wranguiss occupatioun of ye lands of Ingilberisgrange, and ye with-
haldin of ye malis of ye samyn, pertening to the said abbot and his convent,
as was allegit.’' The Lords found that “the Lord Hamiltoun dois na
wrang in the occupatioun of ye lands, nor takin and holdin of ye malis and
proffits yairof.” ⁵

Nor is it improbable that Walter was still Abbot of Dryburgh on
lst July 1476, when another action was “perseuit be a venerable faider
