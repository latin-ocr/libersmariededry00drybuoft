THE PREFACE. - v

Much investigation and research have been made with the view of dis- Ma taken

covering a more ancient and complete Register of Dryburgh, and for theimiiiggme Re egi?

original charters and grants to, and other Instruments connected with, the ter
Abbey. No trace, however, of an older Register has been found ; but a
number of early and interesting charters by De Morville the Constable, the sulze cum-t
Maxwells of Caerlaverock and Pencaitland, the Maitlands of Thirlstane, and prin e’'ritetindri
and others, —as well as charters, tacks of teindS, &c. ,by the Abbots and Appen ndu
Commendators, Rentals of the Abbey, and Accounts of the Chamberlain,

have been recovered from private repositories, and printed in the Amnmx.

With all the imperfections of the Register, it is still a record of great
value, not only for the information it contains relating to the immediate
district in which the Abbey is situated, but also as to the early holdings
of lands, churches, and patronages inthe counties of Fife, Ayr, Lanark,
and the Lothians.

Doubts have been entertained as to the real founder of Dryburgh Abbey. The Founder.
David Ι. styled himself, and he has been generally considered, as the
founder. In his great charter he giveS, grants, and confirms—“ Ecclesiae
Sanctae Mariae de Dryburgh, quam fundavi '⁹ ...... “Ecclesiam de Dry-
burgh,’' &c.¹ But the contemporary Chronicle of Melrose calls “ Hugo de
· Morville fundator Ecclesie de Drieburg.”2

These conflicting statements have given rise to ingenious interpretations
of the meaning of the expression “ quam fundavi,'' in the foundation
charter. Lord Hailes conjectures that the King thereby meant only that
he had laid the foundation stone.³ On the other hand, the author of Cale-
donia thinks the charter better evidence than the Chronicle,⁴ and that David
was the founder of the Abbey3 yet Chalmers himself, in his account of the
