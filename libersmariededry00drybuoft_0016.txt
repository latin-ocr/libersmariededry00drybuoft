viii THE PREFACE.

celebration of the ordinary mass, and such private masses, as, on particular

{gg-{3 SSSSS days, might happen to be said at any of the side altars at the same hour·

After this, they were accustomed to remain some time in private prayer in
the church; and some of them went to confession, in the chapter-house.
Such exercises occupied the. time, until the bell rang for holding the daily
meeting of the chapter3 when they all assembled in the cloister, before pro-
ceeding to the chapter-house3 the transcribers of books, and those at work
out of doors, hastening in to be present with the rest. Every one, as he
entered, bowed towards the place of dignity3 and the abbot‚ when they were
all assembled, invoked a blessing upon them. Suitable prayers having been
said, a lesson was then read from the rules of the order3 and the names of
those appointed to any particular services were read from the register3
every one, on his name being pronounced, bowing reverently, in token of
obedience. Next, the deaths, and other events to be commemorated, were
given out from the calendar. Then the abbot‚ standing in his place, pro-
nounced the absolution of the souls of the dead. T hose who had been
convicted of any fault, were accustomed, at this time, to prostrate themselves
on the ground, and, making an humble confession, entreat forgiveness:
Penance was enjoined, and, if it was judged fit, punishment was sometimes
inflicted on the spot, by the prior, or his deputy. Accusations were
likewise heard by the abbot‚ openly, in the chapter, against any one
under his jurisdiction or authority. The 'business being concluded, they
united in repeating the cxxx. psalm, “De profundis,'' unless it happened
to be a high festival. Then the abbot or president said, “Our help
is in the name of the Lord,'' and the rest added, “Who made heaven
and earth.” In winter, the chapter was concluded at the hour of Tumor,
or nine o’clock3 and the “ Salve Regina ’' having been given out by the
precentor, they proceeded into church, two by two, singing this hymn.
In summer, there was an interval before Tierce, during which they went
about their usual employments. High mass was sung at Tierce in summer3
but at SEx'rE, or twelve o'clock, in winter.
