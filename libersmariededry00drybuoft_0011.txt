THE EDITOR’S PREFAOE.

Tm: Register of the Premonstratensian Abbey of Dryburgh, called the

“ mez S. MAR1AE DE DRYBURGH,'’³ from which the present edition has L nnnnnn
been printed, is a small folio volume of paper, containing one hundred memn'
and twelve leaves, and written in a hand of the sixteenth century. On

a blank leafaat the commencement, it is titled, in the well-known hand-

writing of Sir J ames Balfour, “ Liber S. Μαντὼ de Drybruglze, 1635,” and

at the foot of the first remaining page, it is authenticated with the sub-
scription—“ Jacob-as Baffourius Kynardioe Miles Leo Armorum Rex.'’

It has also been paged by him3 and it is probably as complete now as when

it was in his possession.

It is to be regretted, however, that the Register is an imperfect col- Imperfection
lection. It commences with charter No, 6, and concludes abruptly in the ἔξω Regi*
middle of a charter, No. 316. The first five charters which are wanting
may have occupied two leaves os the volume, and amongst them, probably,
was the foundation-charter of David L, as it was usual to commence the
registers of religious houses with their foundation charters. There are no l

means of ascertaining how many charters are wanting at the end.
