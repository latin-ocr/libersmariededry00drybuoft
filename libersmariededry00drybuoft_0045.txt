THE PREFACE. xxxvii

Dryburgh, since it became the grave of Scott‚ has been invested with an
additional interest. It was preferred by him, that his own remains might
mingle with those os his maternal ancestors, the Haliburtons. But it was,
in any view, a fitting place of sepulture for the Great Minstrel of the Scot-
tish Border. There, amidst the dust of the powerful De Morvilles, and
many a holy Abbot and Monk of old, and surrounded by the ashes of his
own “rough clan,'' under walls scorched in many a Border foray, in the
heart of ν the valley he loved so well, and of the soenes he sung, lie the
mortal remains of that mighty Master who has thrown a charm over the
country, its history, and its traditions, that will live as long as themselves.

EmNBURGn, October 1847.
