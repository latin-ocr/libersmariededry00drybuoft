iv THE PREFACE.

In addition to these defects at the commencement and conclusion of the
Register, it is also to be regretted, that in the greater number of the charters
and instruments which it contains, the names of the witnesses are entirely
omitted 3 and that numerous errors occur in the names of persons and
places}

¹ A few of the eri-ors, sufficient to show the general character of the MS. volume, are here
collected :—

The most palpable of such eri-ors have been corrected in the present edition. Others
which are suspected have been suffered to remain. For instance, Robertus de Morville
appear-ing as a benefactor at a time when Ricardus was the known person of the family,
leads to a doubt that the Transcriber may have mistaken the initial letter of R. in the
original charter, for Robertus, instead of Ricardus. Again‚ in No. 243, where the bishop is
reserving dues from the church of Gullane‚ the wordS, “ quatuor marcis nomine procurationis
nostre et quatuor marcis nomine canonicorum,” plainly contain some mistakffi and there is
reason to believe that the scribe has written canonicorum for cani nostri: The Num-
bers of charters in the present edition do not correspond with the MS. volume after
No. 89: the next number, instead of having been made No. 90 in the MS„ had been by

mistake marked 100, so that this makes an apparent difference of ten more in the MS. than
in the print.
